/*
 These functions implement the AAC transforms.
 
 To analyze, we:
    . chop up the signal into overlapping blocks;
    . multiply each of the blocks by a carefully chosen window function;
    . apply the MDCT to each block.

 To synthesize, we:
    . apply the IMDCT to each block;
    . multiply each of the blocks by the window function used for analysis;
    . sum up the overlapping blocks.
 
 We include a bool called "progress",
 in case we want status updates printed to the console.
